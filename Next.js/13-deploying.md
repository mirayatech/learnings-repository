# üöÄ Deploying Your Next.js App

## **Build Your App for Production**

Running `next build` creates a production-ready version of your app. All the magic lives in the `.next` folder. You'll find HTML files for pages with `getStaticProps` or fancy Automatic Static Optimization, CSS files for styles, and JavaScript for dynamic content. It's like packaging your app in a gift box üéÅ.

## **Vercel - The Easy Button**

Vercel is a hosting platform custom-built for frontend developers. It's a breeze for deploying your Next.js app. Just push your code, and Vercel does the rest. It spots your Next.js app, runs `next build`, and even adds cool extras like performance monitoring, HTTPS, and CI/CD. It's like a supercharged launchpad for your app üöÄ.

## **Roll Your Own Hosting**

If you're the DIY type, you have options:

- **Node.js Server**: Deploy your Next.js app to any Node.js-friendly host, like AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean Droplet. Make sure your `package.json` has "build" and "start" scripts, then `npm run build` and `npm run start` your way to hosting.

- **Docker Image**: If Docker is your jam, create a Docker image of your app, ship it to a container-friendly host, and let it sail. Simplicity in a box üì¶.

- **Static HTML Export**: When you don't need server-side rendering all the time, go for a static HTML export. It's quick and snappy.

- **Other Services**: Plenty of services adore Next.js apps. AWS Copilot, Digital Ocean App Platform, Google Cloud Run, Heroku, Railway, and Render are great for managed servers. GitHub Pages shines for static sites. AWS Amplify, Azure Static Web Apps, Cloudflare Pages, Firebase, Netlify, Terraform, and SST are your pals for serverless setups.

- **Automatic Updates**: Your Next.js app stays up-to-date with the latest version automatically. No manual refresh needed.

- **Manual Graceful Shutdowns**: If you're handling hosting yourself, set the `NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE` environment variable to `true` and manage server shutdowns like a pro.

Remember, deploying is how you share your awesome work, get feedback, and deliver value to your users. So, go ahead, launch your app and let it shine! üåü
