# Introduction to React.js ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the React.js folder! ðŸŽ‰

This folder contains various subfolders covering different topics related to React.js development. React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.

## What is React? ðŸ¤”

React is all about building interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web applications. It allows you to break down your UI into reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain your code.

**React's main features:**

- **Component-Based**: Build UIs using small, reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently update and render components for better performance.
- **Declarative**: Describe how your UI should look, and React handles updates.
- **React Native**: Extend your skills to build mobile apps with React Native.

## Explore the Subfolders ðŸ“‚

Within these subfolders, you'll find various React topics. However, it won't cover the basics like "what's a state" or "what are props" since I'm already familiar with them. Instead, you'll discover topics that might be new or less familiar, such as performance or other advanced concepts.

Feel free to explore these subfolders to deepen your knowledge of React. Enjoy! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
