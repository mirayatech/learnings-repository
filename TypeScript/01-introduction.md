# Introduction to TypeScript üöÄ

Welcome to the TypeScript section in my learning repository!

## TypeScript vs JavaScript ü§î

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means it builds upon JS by adding static types to your code. This helps catch errors early and makes your code more predictable.

## TypeScript and JavaScript Interoperability üîÑ

One of TypeScript's strengths is its seamless interoperability with JavaScript. You can gradually introduce TypeScript into an existing JavaScript project without rewriting everything.

## Installation and Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

To start using TypeScript, you need to install it and configure your project. Here's how to do it using npm:

1. **Installation**: Open your terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

   ```shell
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   This installs TypeScript globally on your system, making it available for any project.

2. **Initialization**: Navigate to your project directory and initialize TypeScript with the following command:

   ```shell
   tsc --init
   ```

   This command generates a `tsconfig.json` file in your project's root directory.

3. **Compiler Options**: Customize TypeScript's behavior by editing the `tsconfig.json` file. This file defines your TypeScript project's settings, including compiler options.

## Running TypeScript üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There are several ways to run TypeScript code:

- **tsc**: Use the TypeScript compiler to convert TypeScript code into JavaScript. Run this command to compile your TypeScript files:

  ```shell
  tsc
  ```

  It will generate JavaScript files from your TypeScript code.

- **ts-node**: Run TypeScript files directly without transpiling. Install `ts-node` globally if you haven't already:

  ```shell
  npm install -g ts-node
  ```

  Then run your TypeScript files like this:

  ```shell
  ts-node your-file.ts
  ```

- **TypeScript Playground**: An online tool to experiment with TypeScript code in your browser. Visit the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and start coding right away.
