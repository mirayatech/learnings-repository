## A Simple Guide to Nest.js Providers 🛠️

Providers are like the helpful workers in your app. They're the tools we use to make our app do things.

### What Are Providers? 🤔

In Nest.js, a provider is a helper tool. It helps the app do its job. Providers make it easy for different parts of the app to work together.

### Why Do We Need Providers? 🧹

We use providers to keep our app organized. They help us write clean and simple code.

### Services: The Helpful Workers 🛠️

One common type of provider is called a service. Services are like the workers in your app. They do jobs like storing data and helping with tasks. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  create(cat: Cat) {
    this.cats push(cat);
  }

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `CatsService` is a helpful worker marked with `@Injectable()` to tell the app it's a tool it can use.

### Using Helpers in Controllers 🕺

In your app, controllers handle requests. They tell the helpers what to do. Controllers use helpers to get tasks done. For example, this is how you'd use a service helper in a controller:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body } from "@nestjs/common";

@Controller("cats")
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}

  @Post()
  async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
```

The 🐾 `CatsService` helper is added to the 🕺 `CatsController` to help with tasks.

### Dependency Injection: How It Works 🚚

Nest.js makes using helpers easy by doing something called "dependency injection." It's like magic that connects parts of your app together.

### Registering Helpers 📋

To use a helper, you need to tell your app to use it. You do this by adding the helper to your app's list of helpers. This happens in a special file, like `app.module.ts`. Here's how:

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, your app knows how to use the 🐾 `CatsService` helper and any other helpers you might have.

### Folder Organization 📁

Here's how your project structure should look:

```
src
├── cats
│   ├── dto
│   │   ├── create-cat.dto.ts
│   ├── interfaces
│   │   ├── cat.interface.ts
│   ├── cats.controller.ts
│   ├── cats.service.ts
├── app.module.ts
├── main.ts
```

With this organized structure, your app is set for success! 🌟

### In Conclusion 🏁

Helpers, or providers, are like the useful tools in your app. They make sure everything works smoothly. By using these helpers, you can write clear and organized code and build powerful web applications.

With this structure, your app will keep growing and stay well-organized,
