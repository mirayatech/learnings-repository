# Core Module üß±

- Decorators are like labels that tell Nest.js about the role of a class.
- `AppModule` is where you define the backbone of your app.

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppController } from "./app.controller";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
