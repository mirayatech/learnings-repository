## Introduction to Nest.js 🚀

Welcome to the Nest.js Basics section in my learning repository! 🌟

### What is Nest.js? 🤔

Nest.js is a Node.js framework built on top of Node.js and Express.js. It's designed for creating efficient, scalable server-side applications. 🌐

In simple terms, a server-side application serves data or information when you ask for it by visiting a specific web address. It's like calling a waiter to get your order in a restaurant, and an API is a perfect example of this. 🪄

### Key Highlights of Nest.js 📦

Nest.js offers several important features, and in Nest.js, everything is organized like a set of classes:

#### Scalability 📈

Nest.js focuses on making your server-side applications adaptable, allowing your application to handle more work as your needs grow.

#### Efficient Development 🛠️

It simplifies development with its easy-to-understand code structure, where everything, from controllers to services, is structured using classes.

#### Powerful Routing 🗺️

Nest.js provides a simple system for managing the flow of data in your application. It's like having a map to guide you to the right destination.
