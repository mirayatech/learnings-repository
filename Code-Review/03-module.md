# 📝 Module 3: Write better code

## 🗝️ Key Principles for Readable Code

1. **Embrace Empathy**:
   - Care deeply about the code's readability. We aim for code that remains understandable and maintainable for years.
   - Prioritize the reader's time over your own.
2. **Take a Stand**:
   - Don't settle for code that merely works; aim for code that's also readable.
     - Explain your code choices.
     - Justify your decisions.

## 📦 Preparing the Pull Request

- Clearly state the "What" - What does the code achieve?
- Explain the "Why" - Why were certain decisions made?
- Include extras if necessary (e.g., screenshots, videos, links to related tickets).
- Share thoughts on what you would do with more time.

## 🚀 Opening the Pull Request

- Begin by reviewing the differences in the code, both in the diff and in the web browser.
- Avoid opening a Pull Request at the end of the day when fatigue can lead to oversights.
- Ensure that builds are passing and there are no conflicts.
- Assign the Pull Request to someone familiar with the codebase.
