# 📈 Module 2: Give better reviews

## 🕵️ What to Look For and Why?

1. **Ownership and Responsibility**
   - Be honest and responsible in your review. Everyone reviewing the code shares the responsibility if issues arise in production.
2. **Prioritize Flaws**
   - Identify flaws first. Tests are valuable, but they can't catch all issues.
3. **Code Readability**
4. **Learning Opportunities**

## 🧐 What to Examine Before Reviewing the Diff

- Check if they followed the guidance (Acceptance Criteria).
- Resolve Conflicts - The author should merge the main branch first to avoid wasting time on code with conflicts.
- Assess whether they addressed the problem.
- Look for screenshots or visual aids.
- Confirm if the tests are passing.

## 📖 Identifying Readability Gaps

- Understand the code's functionality.
- Check for naming conventions.
- Ensure that classes and files are organized correctly.
- Consider potential side effects that could impact other parts of the code.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Code Review Process

1. Read the PR description and related issues/tickets.
2. Assess if you are the appropriate reviewer.

## 👓 Reading for Understanding

- Begin with the essence - focus on the primary changes.
- Comprehend every alteration line by line.
- Approach it as if you are a detective, piecing together the story.

## 💬 Commenting

Save draft comments to fully understand what's happening before posting incorrect or hasty feedback.

## 🗣️ Effective Comments — Why They Matter

- Avoid using "you." Comments should be directed at the code, not the person.
- Nitpick with care - don't sound commanding. Address nitpicks when something isn't right, but don't block a Pull Request for minor issues.
- Provide reasons for your comments.
- Offer background information when necessary.
