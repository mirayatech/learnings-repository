# 🚀 Module 1: Create a better code review process

## 📉 Poor Code Reviews

1. **Example 1:** _“Looks good! 👍”_
   - Not taking code review seriously.
   - Being lazy about reviewing.
2. **Example 2:** _"This code is terrible. We can't maintain this."_
   - Lack of kindness in the team.
   - Seeing each other as competitors.
3. **Example 3:** Your app is broken. Customers are angry, and your ticket queue is growing endlessly. You open a 2-line code review to fix it.

   **Comment:** _"The existing function is unreadable. We should refactor it as part of this change."_

   - Team might not recognize when to make quick changes.
   - Overly focused on perfection or excessive control.

4. **Example 4:** "Here on line 34, we should..." "And on line 45, we should..."
   - Only reviewing the changes, not the whole thing.

## ✅ Effective Code Reviews

   - Boosts individual productivity.
   - Easier to concentrate without interruptions.

2. **Explain Intentions**
