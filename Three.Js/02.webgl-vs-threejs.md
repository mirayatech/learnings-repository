# What is WebGL and Why Use Three.js?

### What is WebGL? 🌐

WebGL is a tool in web programming. It helps create 2D and 3D pictures on websites without extra programs. It's super fast because it uses your computer's special graphics part (GPU).

### What is GPU? 🖥️

A GPU is a computer part that makes pictures and videos look great on screens. It's much faster than the main computer part (CPU) at certain tasks, like drawing things and making images appear quickly.

### GPU vs. CPU ⚡

CPUs are speedy at doing one thing at a time, but GPUs are champs at doing many things at once, like making games look awesome and handling lots of calculations. CPUs are better for stuff like math and AI, while GPUs are the go-to for making graphics shine.

### Why Use Three.js? 🚀

Drawing things in WebGL can be tough and take lots of code. Three.js makes it way easier. It's like a helper for WebGL, so you don't need to write as much code. It's all about making 3D stuff on the web simpler and faster.
