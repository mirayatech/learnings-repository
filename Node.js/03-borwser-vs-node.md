# Browser vs. Node.js

JavaScript works in both web browsers and server-side applications, but they have different purposes:

## 🌐 Browser:

- **🖥️ User Interface:** Allows interaction on web pages, like clicking buttons and showing content.

- **🏛️ DOM Manipulation:** Changes parts of web pages, such as images and text, using the Document Object Model (DOM).

- **🌐 Web APIs:** Provides tools for tasks like getting data from the internet or finding locations.

- **🪟 Window Object:** Offers functions like `alert()` for messages and `setTimeout()` for timing actions.

- **🎨 Rendering Engine:** Displays web content and runs code inside browsers.

## 🚀 Node.js:

- **🌐 Server-Side:** Used for server-side JavaScript, like building web servers and managing data for web applications.

- **⏳ Non-Blocking I/O:** Handles multiple tasks at the same time without waiting, great for serving many users.

- **📦 CommonJS Modules:** Organizes code into parts for better structure and handling dependencies.

- **🚫 No DOM Access:** Can't touch web page elements, not for changing web pages.

- **📅 Event-Driven:** Uses a schedule (event loop) to make sure things happen in order and quickly.

- **📚 npm:** Includes npm (Node Package Manager) for accessing many free tools, making development easier.

In short, browsers manage web page interactions and visuals, while Node.js excels in server-side tasks, data management, and efficient multitasking. Understanding these differences helps you choose how to use JavaScript 💯
