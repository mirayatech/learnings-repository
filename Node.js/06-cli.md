# What is a CLI? 🤖

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a way to talk to your computer by typing words instead of clicking buttons. It's like sending text messages to your computer to get things done. You can use CLIs on any computer, even if it doesn't have a screen 📺

In a CLI, you can use simple words to tell your computer what to do. For example, ` ls`` shows what's inside a folder,  `cd`` moves to a different folder, and `rm`` deletes stuff. You can even make your own CLIs to do whatever you want!

- 🚩 Flags change how a command works. For example, adding ` -a`` to  `ls`` makes it show hidden stuff.
- 🍹 Arguments are like extra information you give to a command. For `mkdir`, you need to tell it the new folder's name.

You can even make your own CLI using Node.js and cool helper tools like `commander` and `yargs`. These tools make it easy to understand what people want and do it.

When you make a CLI, you decide if it should work everywhere (global) or only in one place (local). You can share your CLI with others using "npm" (Node Package Manager), like when you install apps on your phone.

CLIs are super useful, but they're not great for big stuff. For big projects, it's better to use special programs made for coding. 🚀
