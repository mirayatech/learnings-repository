# Navigating Focus like a Pro ðŸš€

> **For Keyboard Users:** _When you use a keyboard, focus rings show you where you are._

**`Tabindex = 0`**

Setting `tabindex` to 0 lets non-clickable things be selected. This helps them become part of the accessibility team. Think of a div with `tabindex` 0 as a friendly wave saying, "Hey, I'm here!"

**`Tabindex of -1`**

Numbers like -1 hide things from the accessibility view. Useful when you want to keep links secret. Users can jump to the good stuff directly!

**`Tabindex of > 1`**

A `tabindex` of 1 moves an item up the selection list. It's like being first in line for focus.
