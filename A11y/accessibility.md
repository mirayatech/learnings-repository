# 🌐 Embracing Web Accessibility

Accessibility is about designing websites that everyone can use, even if they have trouble seeing, hearing, or moving. It's like making the internet friendly for everyone.

It's also about improving user experience, like fixing a button color that's hard to see. It's about making the internet better for everyone.

## 🧠 Why Accessibility is important

Picture your website as a wide-open door for everyone. Just like you'd add a ramp for someone in a wheelchair, web accessibility is like adding ramps for those who use screen readers or solely a keyboard. It's about welcoming everyone and giving them a smooth online journey.
