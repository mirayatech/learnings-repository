# Roles, Names, and ARIA Magic ‚ú®

### Role: **Defining What an Element Does**

```jsx
<div role="button">Click Me</div>
```

### Name: **Giving Elements a Clear Identity**

```jsx
<input type="text" name="email">
```

### The `name` Attribute: Why It's Essential

The `name` attribute acts like a nametag for elements, helping them introduce themselves to assistive tools and users.

```jsx
<button>
<fieldset>
<form>
<iframe>
<input>
<map>
<meta>
<object>
<output>
<param>
<select>
<textarea>
```

# Creating Accessible Names

### Using Element‚Äôs Content (Accessible Name Example): Why It Matters

When the element's content becomes its name, it makes sure the element's purpose is communicated without confusion.

```jsx
<a href="anime.html">Anime Time</a>
```

### Enhancing Images (alt): Why It's Important

The `alt` attribute for images acts as a description for images, making sure users understand their content even if they can't see the image.

```jsx
<img src="tanjiro.png" alt="Character Tanjiro Kamado">
```

### Connecting Elements (label): Why It's Crucial

The `label` element links an input element with its description, making forms more intuitive for everyone.

```jsx
<input type="checkbox" id="Anime">
<label for="Anime">Anime Lover</label>
```

### ARIA for Clear Communication: Why It's Valuable

ARIA attributes like `aria-label` provide extra context about an element's purpose, ensuring all users understand it.

```jsx
<button aria-label="Add to Cart">üõí Add</button>
```

### ARIA with Label Reference: Why It's Beneficial

`aria-labelledby` associates an element with other element's content, making the connection between them clear and meaningful.

```jsx
<h2 id="searchLabel">Search</h2>

<label for="search">Enter search term
  <input type="search" id="search">
</label>

<button aria-labelledby="searchLabel">üîç</button>
```
