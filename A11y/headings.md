# Heading Levels: Your Content's Roadmap 🛤️

Think of headings as road signs for your content! 🚀 They show the way through your webpage and make navigation a breeze.

## Why Headings Are Important

🔍 **Easy Scanning:** Users can quickly scan and understand your content's layout.

🌈 **Accessibility:** Screen readers use headings to guide visually impaired users.

⚡ **SEO Boost:** Search engines rely on headings to grasp your content's structure.

## The Six Heading Levels

HTML gives us six heading levels, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). Remember these tips:

- **One `<h1>` Per Page:** Your main page title should be an `<h1>`.
- **Logical Order:** Use headings in sequence (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) to show content relationships.

## A Simple Code Example

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Let's dive into...</p>
<h2>Main Content</h2>
<p>Explore...</p>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<p>Delve deeper into...</p>
```
