## Introduction to GraphQL 🌐

Welcome to the GraphQL Basics section in my learning repository!

### What is GraphQL? 🤔

GraphQL is a tool that makes requesting data from a server more efficient. Unlike traditional methods, where you might get more or less data than needed, GraphQL allows you to specify exactly what data you want.

_Note: GraphQL was initially developed by Facebook._

### Key Concepts 🗝️

- **Schema:** The plan that defines data types and how to interact with them.
- **Queries:** Questions you ask the server to get specific data.
- **Mutations:** For changing data on the server, like updating a profile.
- **Resolvers:** Functions that get or change data based on queries and mutations.

### Example Query 🚀

```graphql
query {
  getUser(id: "abc123") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
