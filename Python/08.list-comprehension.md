# List comprehension

- list comprehension is a way to create a new list with less syntax

```python
# Looping over a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = []

for number in numbers:
    doubled_number = number * 2
    doubled_numbers.append(doubled_number)

# List comprehension
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
double_numbers = [number * 2 for number in numbers]

```

## LC with strings

```python
name = 'colt'
[char.upper() for char in name] # ['C', 'O', 'L', 'T']
```

## LC woth conditional logic

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]
odds = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 != 0]
```

```python
 [num*2 if num % 2 == 0 else num/2 for num in numbers] # [0.5, 4, 1.5, 8, 2.5, 12]


#  another example

with_no_vowels = [char for char in 'amazing' if char not in 'aeiou'] # ['m', 'z', 'n', 'g']
```

Another List Comp Exercise
For all the numbers between 1 and 100(including 100), create a variable called answer, which contains a list with all the numbers that are divisible by 12. (12, 24, etc)

    ```python
    answer = [num for num in range(1,101) if num % 12 == 0]
    ```

    List Exercises 4

Given the string "amazing", create a variable called answer, which is a list containing all the letters from "amazing" but not the vowels (a, e, i, o, and u). The answer should look like: ['m', 'z', 'n', 'g'].

Use a list comprehension!

<!-- answer = [val for val in 'amazing' if val not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']] -->
