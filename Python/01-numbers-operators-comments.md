## ✅ Equality and Comparison Operators

Learn how to compare values using Python operators.

- `==` Equal To
- `!=` Not Equal To
- `>` Greater Than
- `<` Less Than
- `>=` Greater Than or Equal To
- `<=` Less Than or Equal To

### 📝 Note on Assignment vs Comparison

- A single `=` is used to assign a value to a variable.
- A double `==` is used to compare two values.

### 🧪 Examples of Operators in Action

- `2 ** 3` results in 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
- `4 ** 4` results in 256 (4 raised to the power of 4)

- `10 / 3` results in 3.3333333333333335 (division)
- `10 // 3` results in 3 (floor division)

## 💬 Comments in Python

Comments are notes in your code that are not executed.

- Use `#` for a single line comment.
- Use `"""` for comments spanning multiple lines.
