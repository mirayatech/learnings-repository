# Working with Variables in Python 🛠️

## 📦 Variables

Variables are placeholders for storing data values.

- They must be assigned before use.
- They can be reassigned or changed.
- They can store different types of data.

```Python
x = 5
x * 3 # Results in 15
print(x) # Outputs 5
```
````

### 🔄 Variable Assignment

You can assign one variable to another.

```Python
x = 5
y = x
print(y) # Outputs 5
```

### 🆕 Reassignment

Variables can be updated with new values.

```Python
x = 5
print(x) # Outputs 5
x = 10
print(x) # Outputs 10
```

### 🚀 Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple variables at once.

```Python
x, y = 5, 10
print(x) # Outputs 5
print(y) # Outputs 10
```

## ✏️ Naming Variables

Proper naming is crucial for readable code.

- Start with a letter or an underscore.
- Use letters, numbers, and underscores only.
- Be aware of case sensitivity (`cats` vs `Cats`).

### 📚 Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for most variable names.
- Use `CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes.
- Avoid touching variables with double underscores (`__like_this__`).

## 🧵 String Concatenation

Joining strings with `+` and repeating with `*`.

- `+` combines strings.
- `*` repeats strings.

```Python
name = "John"
print("Hello " + name) # Outputs Hello John
print(name * 3) # Outputs JohnJohnJohn
```

### 🚫 Mixing Types

Be careful not to add strings and numbers directly.

- `"8" + "hello"` results in an error.

### 💬 String Formatting

Use placeholders to insert variables.

```Python
x = 10
formatted = f"I've told you {x} times already!" # Using f-string
# or
formatted = "I've told you {} times already!".format(10) # Using format()
```

## 🔗 Interpolation

Insert variables into strings with f-strings.

```Python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello {name}") # Outputs Hello John
```

## 🔢 Strings & Indices (Indexes)

Strings in Python are indexed with each character having a designated position.

```Python
word = 'Python'
first_letter = word[0] # 'P'
second_letter = word[1] # 'y'
```

### 📍 Accessing Characters

You can access specific characters in a string using their index.

```Python
name = "Python"
print(name[0]) # Outputs 'P'
print(name[3]) # Outputs 'h'
```

### ✂️ Slicing Strings

Get parts of strings by slicing with indices.

```Python
name = "Python"
slice = name[0:3] # 'Pyt'
print(slice)
```

### 🔄 Reverse Indexing

Use negative numbers to start from the end of the string.

```Python
name = "Python"
last_letter = name[-1] # 'n'
second_last = name[-2] # 'o'
```

## 🛑 Important Notes on String Usage

- Consistently use single (`' '`) or double (`" "`) quotes.
- Escape quotes inside strings with a backslash (`\"` or `\'`).

```Python
quote = "He said, \"Python is awesome!\""
conversation = 'She replied, \'I agree!\''
```

- You can use triple quotes for strings that span multiple lines.

```Python
multi_line_string = """This is a string
that spans across multiple lines
in the Python script."""
```
